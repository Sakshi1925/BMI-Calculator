##### 1\.**Problem Statement**



Many individuals struggle to easily calculate and understand their Body Mass Index (BMI), which is an important indicator of health.Manual calculation may lead to errors and incorrect interpretation of health categories. There is a need for a simple and reliable tool that can compute BMI quickly and provide clear feedback to the user. The BMI Calculator solves this by automating the calculation and providing instant results.



##### 

##### **2. Scope of the Project**

##### 

The project focuses on creating a simple application that:



(a) Accepts height and weight as inputs.



(b) Calculates BMI using the standard formula.



(c) Displays the calculated BMI along with the corresponding health category.



(d) The scope is limited to BMI computation and basic interpretation.



(e) The project may be implemented as a console application, GUI, or web app depending on the course requirements.
